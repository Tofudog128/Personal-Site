      <p>I had always wanted a place to showcase my projects and interests, but building a website from scratch sounded intimidating. In April 2025, I finally took the plunge using basic HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>The process taught me about structuring content, styling pages, and even publishing through GitHub Pages. One of the most rewarding parts was seeing how small code changes could bring my design to life.</p>
      <p>My advice: don’t wait to be perfect. Just start. Your site can grow and evolve just like your skills do.</p>
